   <h3>Mitigating personal information exposure on the web</h3>
   <p>
     This literature review studies the topic of mitigating personal
     information exposure on the web. This is considered an important topic
     because increasingly more of the world population has access to the
     internet with minimal education on how our personal information is used and
     how to keep it safe. When conducting research the three topics found to be
     the most relevant when mitigating personal information exposure on the web
     were: why and how we disclose personal information, how to manage personal
     information and how to know when our personal information is being used.
   </p>
   <h3>Why and how we disclose personal information:</h3>
   <p>
     When looking at how web users disclose their data, several studies had
     ideas on how the web is used and why anyone would disclose their data
     online. Typical use of the internet includes consuming media, shopping and
     building relationships online daily (Kim and Kim, 2018, p.1; Chen,  Chen
     and Lam 2008 ). The value and importance of data is increasing, (Kim and
     Kim, 2018, p.1) with many people often feeling pressure to disclose
     personal data online for various reasons, such as an obligation to be a
     member of a website ( Chouseinoglou, Ög˘ütçü, and Testik, 2015). The
     reluctance of consumers to provide personal information is increased when
     they feel they cannot control the privacy risk (Kim and Kim, 2018, p.3).
     As the value of data increases, more companies will try to gain internet
     users data. These companies will spend lots of money on marketing
     techniques to get this data, internet users are often lured in.
   </p>
   <p>
     Several of studies have looked at the ranking of self-disclosed data on
     social media sites, self-disclosed data is data that is provided by the
     user. The first study by Lam, Chen, and Chen concluded the order was (in
     order of most disclosed): nickname, gender, birthday, introduction,
     education, blood, email, height, occupation, yahoo id, MSN id, weight and
     skype id (2008, p.5) this data is however limited to the social media
     platform Wretch. A study by Acquisti and Gross found that the order of data
     disclosed on Facebook was different: Name, Profile image, birthday, high
     school, AIM screen name, hometown, relationship status, music/movie
     preference, interests, relationship partner (2005, p.5). Birthday data
     would appear to be most common, birthday data on Facebook allows other
     users to post birthday messages on the users' profile, meaning the
     incentive to give a fake birthday is unclear (Acquisti and Gross, 2005,
     p.6). Having lots of personal information such as birthdays online leaves
     people open to identity fraud, “Identity theft is one of the fastest
     growing white-collar crimes…”(Griffiths, 2003).
   </p>
   <p>
     In the same study performed by Lam, Chen and Chen they set out to prove
     that even if users do not expose personal information online, others may
     for them (2008, p.1) Free form text on the social media platform Wretch
     allowed users to input text about each other. From this text, the study
     managed to infer 72% of the users' first names (2008, p.8).
   </p>
   <p>
     In 2015, 4.15 billion people had a mobile phone (Statista, 2016). Mobile
     phones contain lots of personal information, due to the number of
     applications upon them (Bakopoulou, Choffnes, Le, Markopoulou, Mehrabadi
     and Shuba, 2018).Lots of papers agree that sometimes the transmission of
     Personal information is justified, such as location information when using
     the application Google maps. However, they all also agree that there can be
     a malicious side to sharing personal data, such as stalking and harassment.
     (Bakopoulou, Choffnes, Le, Markopoulou, Mehrabadi and Shuba, 2018; Kim and
     Kim, 2018; Lam, Chen & Chen, 2008 ). Mobile phones should be used with
     caution as they have the power to share personal information without the
     users' knowledge.
   </p>
<h3>How to know when our personal information is being used:</h3>
  <p>
    For the most part web users do not know how their personal information is
    shared and for what purpose, they do not have control over their data
    (Bakopoulou, Choffnes, Le, Markopoulou, Mehrabadi and Shuba, 2018). As there
    is ever increasing data online, one way to make data more relevant for the
    user is through personal recommendation systems. Recommendation systems
    recommend data based on objective behaviour or explicitly stated preferences
    . Although accumulated data may help users, they may also feel uncomfortable
    being monitored(Kim and Kim, 2018).
  </p>
  <p>
    Bakopoulou Et Al. paper details their system for a secure and efficient
    on-device packet level monitoring and detection of sensitive information.
    This system would show all users of applications if the application
    transmits personal information over a network, and where personal
    information is being sent to (2018). If users are given more information
    about where their data is going then they can make more informed decisions
    on which applications to keep on their phone.
  </p>
<h3>How to manage our personal information:</h3>
  <p>
    Many people are using the internet, the world bank reports that as of 2013,
    38.1% of the world population is using the internet, whereas 42% of the
    households own a computer(World bank, 2014, cited in Chouseinoglou, Ög˘ütçü
    and Testik, 2015, p.1). Despite this level of technology individuals
    behaviours with regard to protecting their own privacy have not progressed
    (Chouseinoglou, Ög˘ütçü, and Testik, 2015), with many users downloading data
    and applications by default (Bakopoulou, Choffnes, Le, Markopoulou,
    Mehrabadi and Shuba, 2018). This often leads to the overlook of privacy
    statements and in turn the privacy of the user's data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Multiple of studies concluded that privacy settings are useful but not
    sufficient in managing personal data (Bakopoulou, Choffnes, Le, Markopoulou,
    Mehrabadi and Shuba, 2018; Chen, Chen and Lam, 2008).  One paper outlines
    three ways to stop exposure, these are, privacy settings, getting an owners
    confirmation of data that will be published about them and browser scope
    settings, for example, a group of people need to accept someone wanting to
    join the group( Chen, Chen, and Lam, 2008).
  </p>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
  <p>
    To conclude, users self-disclose personal information online and often on
    social media platforms. Social media platforms normally have applications
    that users instinctually accept to download on the users' phone, the privacy
    statements are rarely read. These applications can transmit personal
    information over networks, transmitting data over a network is likely to
    lead to malicious attacks on data. The technology to track personal data
    being sent over a network has been developed but needs more time before its
    publicly useable. In the meantime, privacy settings are useful but will not
    stop data leakage. Furthermore, any application that allows another user to
    post data about a user should first seek the approval of the user, the user
    should be uncomfortable about what others are sharing about them if the
    application doesn’t have this capability.
