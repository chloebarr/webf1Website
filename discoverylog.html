    <h3>Week One</h3>
    <p>This week we looked at the VM, I will need to research what a VM is. A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. In other words, a computer is created within a computer. It runs in a window, much like any other program, giving the end user the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on the host operating system itself. (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/overview/what-is-a-virtual-machine/)
        The virtual machine will be helpful to learn Linux commands on and create web servers for web development.
        </p>
    <h3>Week Two</h3>
    <p>This week we looked at information and social engineering, We created a document about the information we create daily, we then categorized the information into secret, sensitive or public. It was interesting to see the enormity of how much information we do create daily. Keeping the data we create every day safe is a huge challenge so by categorizing it we could see what data we would store if we were to make a social media platform.
        </p>
    <h3>Week Three</h3>
    <p>This week we have been issued our first coursework, write a literature review on mitigating the risk of personal data online. The first step of this will be to perform a skim read of some related papers and then create a plan of which papers to read fully and take notes on.
        </p>
    <h3>Week Four</h3>
    <p>This week we looked at how to write in an academic style. What is academic writing, Academic writing is a particular style used in formal essays and other assessments for your course. It requires formal language, a logical structure and should be supported by evidence. Most sentences in a literature review should contain a citation, and none of the work should be one's opinion but a summary of other peoples research.
        </p>
    <h3>Week Five</h3>
    <p>This week we were introduced to HTML. What is HTML, Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphics, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages. All HTML files have to be started with (!doctype html).

    <h3>Week Six</h3>
    <p>Consolidation week, peer marked ten peoples literature reviews with ten marking criteria some had more effort spent on them than others.</p>
    <h3>Week Seven</h3>
    <p>This week we looked at separating form from content by using CSS, specifically using CSS in a separate file. What is CSS, Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
        </p>
    <h3>Week Eight</h3>
    <p>This week we looked at productivity and efficiency, customising your IDE and using tools to tidy up your code. On atom and visual studio code(both good HTML editors), you can download add-ons such a beautify to help format your code.
        </p>
    <h3>Week Nine</h3>
    <p>This week we looked at design, and using the MVC design pattern. The MVC design pattern (model, view and controller) has three considerations; information design, technical and architectural design and interaction design. Information design model is about whats on your website and why. Interaction design view is how your website will be laid out, what colours will be used, etc. interaction design controller is providing consistent navigation tools across the site, consistency of colours, etc. technical and architectural design is the file system design, web standards and access control.
        </p>
    <h3>Week Ten</h3>
    <p>This week we looked at using images in a website and accommodating for different thresholds and qualities, by having multiple different images of different sizes.
        </p>
    <h3>Week Twelve</h3>
    <p>this week we had a Christmas lecture where the lecturers made a Christmas jumper in HTML.</p>

        </p>
    <h3>Week Fourteen</h3>
    <p>we looked at the mark scheme for our website coursework, so I started making my website with a basic page for each requirement. I have found that you can edit documents on the VM with Visual studio code and then install a live page plugin for chrome, to effectivly live edit a page.</p>
